###"Baby Steps" for a new language implementation

Rough TODO list based on 
https://github.com/servirtium/README/blob/master/starting-a-new-implementation.md

Steps:

1. Start with an implementation of "direct" with tests **DONE**

2. Implement the "playback" for the same test cases

3. Adding "record" mode

4. Extract the library from the climate demo, to its own repo

5. Other HTTP verbs other than 'GET'

6. Add a capability for a "Note".

7. Proxy Server mode of operation
